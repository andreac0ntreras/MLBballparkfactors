Steps to get running:

1) Within the zip file there is a .ipynb file called Project_Code.ipynb; This is the driver code to see the statistical analysis.

2) There should also be a .csv file called datacapstone.csv; This is the spreadsheet containing all the data pertaining to each ballpark within the chosen variables.

3) At the top of the code, all the required packages are imported, it is of utmost importance that block of code is run first or the rest will not function.


The code does not require any special actions or manipulation, it will just run if the previous steps are ensured to be correct.
